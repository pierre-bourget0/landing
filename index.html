			<h2>1. The location</h2>
			<p>Situated in the East of the Carabean waters, our company grant you access to a little house that looks like a sphere, deep down the ocean at 200 meters. It can fear a bit people to know that they are below earth surface but it's totally securized: the glasses and all the materials as well. It's high technologies quality (so do not worry about a fish attack while you are in the sphere :) ).</p>

			<h2>2. Me</h2>
